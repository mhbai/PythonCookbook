      "Rediscovering Indonesia?s Charms: Business Goes South, Again\n",
      "(Liu Yingfeng/photos by Jimmy Lin/tr. by Jonathan Barnard)\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a nation that in 2013 enjoyed GDP growth of over 5%. It constitutes a large market with a population of 250 million. It is one of the leading lights of ASEAN. Turning over a new leaf, Indonesia has cast off its image of being a place fraught with instability.\n",
      "After being battered by the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, Indonesia has recaptured the world?s attention. Over two decades ago the country was the focus of ?go south? ?efforts by the Taiwanese business community, which is launching a similar effort now.\n",
      "More than 8000 Taiwanese companies in fields ranging from textiles, readymade garments and food, to electronics and computers, have made their way to Indonesia, in step with the nation?s economic advance. As the doors to Taiwan?Indonesian? trade have been thrown open, there has been a new wave of Taiwanese companies going south.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early on Sunday morning, the citizens of Jakarta take advantage of a ban on motor vehicle traffic on certain streets. Where traffic often crawls during the week, young workers ride bicycles and stroll back and forth in groups. As music blares, Muslim women wearing burnt sienna, bright green and royal purple headscarves sway to the beat, waving their hands. One smiling young face after another captures the spirit of Indonesia: young and energetic.\n",
      "Rising from financial crisis\n",
      "In October of 2013 representatives of APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) member nations gathered on the Indonesian island of Bali. Before his departure for the APEC CEO Summit, Terry Gou of Fox?conn described his company?s plans to invest in a cell phone plant in Indonesia. ?Indonesia is the next Asian land of opportunity for Foxconn,? Gou said. His words bear witness to a trend: Taiwanese companies are once again shifting their focus southward.\n",
      "As the ASEAN Economic Community prepares to launch in 2015, Indonesia, with its more than 17,000 islands, constitutes its second largest market and stands at the center of the global economic stage. \n",
      "Two years after the global financial ?crisis of 2008, Indonesia experienced 6% growth. The mark really caught the world?s ?attention. \n",
      "Setting one economic record after another, Indonesia attracted swarms of investors. In 2012 the French company L?Or?al invested ?100 million in West Java, creating the largest base for cosmetics production in the world. General Motors, which had pulled out of Indonesia years before, also unveiled plans for reestablishing factories there.\n",
      "A large population and growing middle class \n",
      "In September of 2013, news that the United States would be curtailing quantitative easing caused some volatility on the Indonesian stock market, but quite a few investors still had confidence in Indonesia.\n",
      "?A key factor is that Indonesia has a young population of 250 million,? says Liu Wei?zheng, who specializes in Indonesia funds for Yuanta? Securities. Indonesia?s average age is 29, with 60% of the population between 20 and 50. Now is a prime time for businesses to reap demographic benefits.\n",
      "?For exporters, a high proportion of the population in the young prime of their lives means ample pools of labor,? Liu says. ?For those aiming to meet domestic demand, the large population makes for a huge market.? Liu explains that if incomes did not grow in step with population, it would have created a financial burden for the nation. Fortunately, Indonesian per-capita income has doubled in ten years, exceeding US$3500 in 2013 and quelling foreigners? doubts. \n",
      "Rising incomes have lifted many Indonesians into the middle class.\n",
      "?Indonesians these days don?t merely want to keep from going hungry,? remarks China?trust senior vice president Peter Liu, who previously headed up the company?s operations in Indonesia. ?Now they want to eat well, too. And with their extra cash, they want to buy refrigerators, cars and other consumer goods.?\n",
      "Over the last five years, at least 40 department stores have opened in Jakarta. Last year the French department store chain Galeries Lafayette announced a plan to ?return to Asia,? and Jakarta was one of its planned locations.\n",
      "Cars and cell phones\n",
      "The traffic problems in Jakarta that so vex locals and Taiwanese expat businesspeople alike are another indication of Indonesia?s economic rise. \n",
      "?The increasing traffic issues bear witness to Indonesia?s economic advance,? says Pak Windy, a second-generation Indonesian ethnic Chinese who is a marketing manager for Ja?ba?beka, an industrial estate developer. \n",
      "Estimates are that 1 million new cars and 8 million new motorcycles and scooters hit Indonesian roads every year. Honda and Toyota, which together have 90% of the Indonesian automotive market, have been steadily opening new factories. \n",
      "Possessing two or three cell phones is also common in ?Indonesia.\n",
      "In 2012, 50 million cell phones were sold in Indonesia. That?s eight times the figure for Taiwan. At department store specialty counters locally made Cross phones compete with Korean Sam?sungs, Canadian BlackBerries, and Taiwanese HTCs for the affections of young consumers.\n",
      "?Low-cost labor is already a thing of the past in Indonesia,? notes Charly Chiu, director general of the Taiwan Chamber of Commerce in Jakarta, taking stock of the nation?s economic transformation. ?Now it?s domestic demand that offers the greatest potential for future growth.?\n",
      "Returning to meet local demand\n",
      "In the 1990s, with the ROC government pushing investment in Southeast Asia, Indonesia was momentarily a hotspot for investment. But Indonesia?s political and economic turmoil in 1997 caused quite a few Taiwanese firms to step back and reconsider. Many of them decided to direct their investment to mainland China instead. However, with the recent period of weak demand from the American and European markets and rising labor costs in mainland China, quite a few Taiwanese businesses have begun to take another look at this rising star to the south.\n",
      "Chinatrust?s Peter Liu explains that numerous textile, clothing, shoe, and auto parts manufacturers have established plants in Indonesia. But recently a new wave of ?companies?including retail food and drink chains, computer and electronics companies and others?have come with the objective of serving domestic demand.\n",
      "The Taiwanese coffee chain Dante came in 2006 via the efforts of ?Hengky Wi?jaya, a second-generation Chinese ?Indonesian.\n",
      "Unlike in Taiwan, where Dante focuses mainly on the low-price market, ?Hengky opened the first Indonesian Dante in a luxury department store in Jakarta, targeting middle and high-income consumers and spending US$300,000 on the 330-square-meter space. The company now has 25 shops in various Indonesian cities.\n",
      "Dendy Sja?hada, a third-generation Berkeley- and Harvard-educated Chinese Indonesian who is an aficionado of xiao?long?bao steamed dumplings, brought the renowned Tai?pei eatery Din Tai Fung to Indonesia. Even though the prices are 20% higher than in Taiwan, the branch in Jakarta?s Pacific Place department store is always jam-packed.\n",
      "What?s more, Taiwanese drinks chains, including CoCo Fresh Tea and Juice, Ding Tea, Cha?time, and Quickly, have all made the move to Indonesia, whether as joint ventures or via company-authorized agents. \n",
      "In 2000 Makalot Industrial, a clothing manufacturer, established a 5000-worker plant in Indonesia. Last year, it quickened its pace of expansion. It plans to launch its own clothing line named Fisso in Indonesia this year.\n",
      "Tsai Wayi, executive assistant to Makalot?s CEO, points out that although Gap, Uni?qulo and Zara are already established in Indonesia, foreign clothing brands only occupy about 5% of its highly fractured market, where no players dominate. ?Southeast Asia is an excellent place to launch a brand, and now is a great time to stake out a piece of the Indonesian market.?\n",
      "Maxxis, a major tire manufacturer which had been selling to the Indonesian market via a local agent for ten years, announced in November of 2013 that it would be investing US$80 million in a factory in Indonesia, with the aim of supplying Japanese auto companies.\n",
      "Sweet fruits of success\n",
      "Vincent ?Hsiao, chairman of Shen?chang Electric, a manufacturer of equipment for transformer boxes, deeply understands the power of the domestic market.\n",
      "When his father passed away in 1989, ?Hsiao, then just 25, took over the reins of the company. At the time, Taiwan Power was Shen?chang?s biggest customer. With Taiwan being thrown open to imports under GATT, he knew the company would be facing a future of much greater competition. It was then that Hsiao began to think about going abroad to find new markets.\n",
      "Hsiao checked out mainland China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand, before heeding the ROC government?s call to ?go south? and borrowing US$3.2 million to invest in a factory in Indonesia.\n",
      "He wasn?t expecting that just six months later the Southeast Asian financial crisis would spread from Thailand to Indonesia. When the 20,000-square-meter factory on the west side of Jakarta was completed, three shareholders flew in from Taiwan. On that very day the rupiah?s value plummeted, with the US dollar breaking the Rp10,000 barrier. Some 70% of their investment had disappeared into thin air, and their debt had increased four times. Their plan to get listed on the Taiex ended sadly.\n",
      "Shen?chang had originally decided to establish a factory in Indonesia with the aim of tapping into domestic demand. ?Hsiao had consequently aggressively sought out local partners, hoping they would provide the company with an entr?e into the Indonesian electrical equipment market.\n",
      "Via customer referrals, ?Hsiao found a local company that agreed to help him expand and find new sales channels. ?Unexpectedly, on the night before the two were to sign an agreement, one of ?Hsiao?s competitors stepped in and pressured ?Hsiao?s partner-to-be into backing away from the deal.\n",
      "Left without any other options, ?Hsiao formed a partnership with a middleman that had worked with Shen?chang before. Thanks to the firm?s understanding of the Indonesian market, the connections it had built up over the years, and its sales channels, Shen?chang?s equipment gradually became part of the supply chain for the Indonesian state-run electric company. \n",
      "In 2004 Indonesia?s economy had begun to revive, and ?Hsiao began to sense growing strength in the domestic market. Four years later, the electric equipment market entered a period of explosive growth. \n",
      "Unlike Taiwan, with its 99.9% electrification rate, ?Hsiao believes that Indonesia will see growing demand for electricity infrastructure. With the quickening pace of construction there, the grid will be extended. ?Wherever there are new homes, there is a need for electric lines and transformer boxes,? he says. \n",
      "After 17 years of hard work, Shen?chang today has garnered nearly 30% of Indonesia?s domestic transformer box market. It is enjoying the fruits of its hard work and planning.\n",
      "Disparity of wealth\n",
      "Today Indonesia stands at the crossroads of economic transformation. It has much to be proud of in its economic advance. Yet there are a few concerns worth noting.\n",
      "For instance, corruption is still a serious issue. According to Transparency International?s Corruption Perception Index, Indonesia ranks an unimpressive 118 out of 176 (meaning 117 nations are considered less corrupt). \n",
      "And a growing disparity of wealth is a side effect of Indonesia?s boom.\n",
      "In October, Indonesia enters the wet season, and the rain comes down in buckets in the afternoon. One car after another stops along the streets to pick up or unload passengers. Frail children with umbrellas scurry up to ?pedestrians, hoping to earn paltry tips. \n",
      "Along elevated highways leading into the capital of Jakarta, one can see fashionable shopping centers on one side and ramshackle slums on the other. The lives of the 11% of the population that still lives under the poverty line provide grim reminders that not everything here is bright and colorful in these boom times.\n",
      "In the 17th century the abundant spices found on the Indonesian archipelago brought the Portuguese and Dutch, who battled each other for supremacy. Some four centuries later multinational corporations based in Taiwan, Japan, Korea and the United States are now vying with each other for market share on these same ?islands. \n",
      "Having emerged from the financial crisis, Indonesia is groping its way toward the future, making steady progress in its quest to join the ranks of developed nations.\n",
